  "description": "- A simple secret sharing application that allows users to share secrets with others securely. - Users can create a secret message (that only, I-the developer, can read) and share it with others.        :) - Message can be encrypted and decrypted using a password (although, i won't need any of that)              ;) - Users can also set an expiration time for the secret message. - Also, user can set maximum number of views for the secret message, after which the message will be deleted from the database (in this case, I won't be able to read it anymore)               :(",
