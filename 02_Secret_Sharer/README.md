# Secret Sharer

- A simple secret sharing application that allows users to share secrets with others securely.
- Users can create a secret message (that only, I-the developer, can read) and share it with others.        :)
- Message can be encrypted and decrypted using a password (although, i won't need any of that)             ;)
- Users can also set an expiration time for the secret message.
- Also, user can set maximum number of views for the secret message, after which the message will be deleted from the database (in this case, I won't be able to read it anymore)             :(
